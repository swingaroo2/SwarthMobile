Swarthmobile
============

An Android App for Swarthmore students

Swarthmobile aims to provide useful information to Swarthmore College students in a convenient format.
Accessing the Dash is cumbersome from a mobile device and checking from a laptop or larger computer
cannot be done while in transit. Swarthmobile is the fix to this issue.

This app will (eventually) consist of a number of applets, listed as they are added:

Campus Events (in progress):
-----------------------------

NOTE: The following description details desired functionality, not the applet's current state.

Users can select a date range (or two predefined shortcuts) in which to view campus events.
Users will be presented with a scrolling list of days in their range. Touching any of these
days will populate a custom ListView of events for that day.

Each list item contains a brief overview of a campus event; clicking the arrow will lead to
a screen with more detailed information. Events can be added to the native Android calendar
at the touch of a button. The campus events webpage can be accessed if the user so desires.
